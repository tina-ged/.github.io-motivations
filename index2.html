   <h1> god is here for you </h1>
   
   <p1> whenever life brings you down , remember that only one person will always love you . God's power is stronger than anything , he can restore you soul when you can't even love yourself . his love for you is deeper than the ocean . just close your eyes and listen to him through everything , literally everything : through your friends , your family , nature , birds symphony ... God is not going to forget to put the people in your life that are meant to be there. God knew what he was doing from the beginning ; leave it in his hands. </p1>
